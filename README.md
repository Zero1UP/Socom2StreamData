# Socom2StreamData
Gathers information from the game so you can make a stream overlay for OBS
This should work with all versions of PCSX2.

Select Window Capture and call it whatever you want. I tend to name mine after the windows that they represent. (ex. Seals, Scoreboard)
For window Select the window you wish to be displayed and hit Ok.

Repeat this for the rest of the windows if you want them to appear and then you can move them around your scene like so:

If you aren't able to see the windows in the scene make sure they are above your PCSX2 source as seen in the first image.


Special thanks to Harry62 for creating the interface and answering any questions I had about the game.
